Locations from the Wizarding World franchise will be explorable such as the Forbidden Forest, Diagon Alley, and Hogsmeade. During character creation the player is able to choose their appearance, house, and gender. Players will be able to customize their character's voice, body type and add accessories such as glasses in character creation. Level progression will allow the player to access and upgrade different spells, talents, and abilities.\n\nHogwarts Legacy is set in the 1890s and follows a student starting at Hogwarts in the fifth year. As the player is starting at the school later than other students, a wizards field guide is given by the Ministry of Magic. Completing sections of this guide through exploration provides additional information and experience points. The player character, who holds the key to an \"ancient secret that threatens to tear the wizarding world apart\", is capable of manipulating a mysterious ancient magic, and will need to help uncover why this forgotten magic has suddenly made a resurgence and the ones that are simultaneously trying to harness it.",

Locations from the Wizarding World franchise will be explorable such as the Forbidden Forest, Diagon Alley, and Hogsmeade. During character creation the player is able to choose their appearance, house, and gender. Players will be able to customize their character's voice, body type and add accessories such as glasses in character creation. Level progression will allow the player to access and upgrade different spells, talents, and abilities.\n\nHogwarts Legacy is set in the 1890s and follows a student starting at Hogwarts in the fifth year. As the player is starting at the school later than other students, a wizards field guide is given by the Ministry of Magic. Completing sections of this guide through exploration provides additional information and experience points. The player character, who holds the key to an \"ancient secret that threatens to tear the wizarding world apart\", is capable of manipulating a mysterious ancient magic, and will need to help uncover why this forgotten magic has suddenly made a resurgence and the ones that are simultaneously trying to harness it.",

Locations from the Wizarding World franchise will be explorable such as the Forbidden Forest, Diagon Alley, and Hogsmeade. During character creation the player is able to choose their appearance, house, and gender. Players will be able to customize their character's voice, body type and add accessories such as glasses in character creation. Level progression will allow the player to access and upgrade different spells, talents, and abilities.\n\nHogwarts Legacy is set in the 1890s and follows a student starting at Hogwarts in the fifth year. As the player is starting at the school later than other students, a wizards field guide is given by the Ministry of Magic. Completing sections of this guide through exploration provides additional information and experience points. The player character, who holds the key to an \"ancient secret that threatens to tear the wizarding world apart\", is capable of manipulating a mysterious ancient magic, and will need to help uncover why this forgotten magic has suddenly made a resurgence and the ones that are simultaneously trying to harness it.",

Locations from the Wizarding World franchise will be explorable such as the Forbidden Forest, Diagon Alley, and Hogsmeade. During character creation the player is able to choose their appearance, house, and gender. Players will be able to customize their character's voice, body type and add accessories such as glasses in character creation. Level progression will allow the player to access and upgrade different spells, talents, and abilities.\n\nHogwarts Legacy is set in the 1890s and follows a student starting at Hogwarts in the fifth year. As the player is starting at the school later than other students, a wizards field guide is given by the Ministry of Magic. Completing sections of this guide through exploration provides additional information and experience points. The player character, who holds the key to an \"ancient secret that threatens to tear the wizarding world apart\", is capable of manipulating a mysterious ancient magic, and will need to help uncover why this forgotten magic has suddenly made a resurgence and the ones that are simultaneously trying to harness it.",
